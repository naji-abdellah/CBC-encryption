# CBC-encryption
This project implements Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) encryption and decryption using a linked list to process data read from a file. The encryption ensures that each block depends on the previous one, enhancing security by preventing identical plaintext blocks from producing identical ciphertext blocks.
